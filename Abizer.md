Create the train and test dataframes

Define a winner variable, which is based on winner16 variable. Winner is
set as Democrat if winner16 is Dem and Republican if winner16 is Rep

We chose the x-variables by determining which variables were most
significant using a regression analysis.

We then fit the model “winner.glm” into the train and test data to
create probabilities. We then set a threshold of 0.05. For example, if
the model determines the probability to be 0.1, prediction will be
Republican or else Democrat. We then calculated the accuracy, precision
and recall for the model. Then, we created a double density curve

Here, we created a ROC curve for the training data

I calculated the error of the model using a 5-fold cross validation and
a 0.05 threshold

    [1] 0.1257533

The error is 0.126

Random Forest

Created a random forest model with 300 trees that randomly select out of
5 variables at each split. Then we fitted the model to the training data
and the testing data. We then calculated the accuracy, precision, recall
and error for the training data predictions

      accuracy precision    recall      error
    1 0.910004 0.9302326 0.9663667 0.08999598

The error is 0.09 and the accuracy is 0.91

Here, we used the k nearest neighbours model with k = 10. We then
compute the accuracy, precision, recall and error for the model K-nn

    [1] 1991    8
    [1] 123   8
       accuracy precision    recall     error
    1 0.8734431 0.8811545 0.9834202 0.1265569

Error is 0.127 and accuracy is 0.873

We use random forest to predict our model. We added the predictions to
the table test_No_Y and and created a csv file
