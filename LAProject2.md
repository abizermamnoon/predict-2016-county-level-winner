Team Project 2

Abizer and Luis
Day 17

In this project, we used the training dataset to create a model that
predicts the county- level winner of the 2016 Presidential Election. The
winner of each county is classified as Democrat (Clinton) and Republican
(Rep)

We were concerned that there would be NA values in the “winner16”
variable. To remove the NAs, we created a new variable called “winner”
that omits the NA values. “Winner” variable is classified as Democrat if
the actual winner is “Dem” and Republican if the actual winner is “Rep”.

    [1] Republican Republican Republican Republican Democrat   Republican
    Levels: Democrat Republican

The fun part was deciding the variables we wanted to use in order to
create our model. We ran a regression analysis with the 51 predictor
variables and deciphered that 17 of them were significant. However, we
wanted to avoid overfitting hence we ran a regression analysis with
these 17 variables against the winner variable and chose only those
variables that had a significance level less than 0.0001. We were also
concerned that some of these variables might be correlated to each other
which might be affecting their significance level. To examine this, we
ran a individual regression analysis for each variable against the
winner variable and chose the ones that were still significant. After
doing this procedure, we concluded that retail sales, income/capita,
median house value, percentage of population living in multi unit
housing, languages other English spoken at home, percentage of
population who have completed undergraduate degree or higher, percentage
of population living in same housing for multiple years and percentage
change in population are significant.

We then fit the model “winner.glm” into the train and test data to
create probabilities. We then set a threshold of 0.05. For example, if
the model determines the probability to be 0.1, prediction will be
Republican or else Democrat. We then calculated the accuracy, precision
and recall for the model. Then, we created a double density curve

    1 0.8750502 0.8725166 0.9985789

The double density curve indicates that most Republicans have an
estimated probability of winning around 90%. Probability of Democrats
winning is not defined so well but range lower than a Republican

The accuracy for the logistic regression model is 0.875

Here, we created a ROC curve for the training data

The ROC curve suggests that our model is very good because it is close
to a right angled triangle and has a higher sensitivity than a random
classifier.

I calculated the error of the model using a 5-fold cross validation and
a 0.05 threshold

    [1] 0.1257533

The error is 0.126

Random Forest

We then created a random forest model called winner_rforest with 400
trees that randomly select out of 4 variables at each split. To choose
the number of bootstrapped trees and the number of predictors to
randomly select, we tried numbers around 400 and 4 respectively. We
noticed that the accuracy goes down if we input more/less predictors or
more/less trees hence we decided to stick with 400 trees and 4
predictors to randomly select. Then we fitted the model to the training
data, and calculated the accuracy, precision, recall and error for the
training data predictions.

      accuracy precision    recall      error
    1 0.910004 0.9302326 0.9663667 0.08999598

Our accuracy was 0.91 and error was 0.09.

After running the two models, it was clear that the random forest model
gave us the highest accuracy of 0.91 and lowest error of 0.09 so we went
ahead with that model for our predictions.
